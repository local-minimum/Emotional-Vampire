Construct jokes and puns out of their parts.
Gage the reaction you get.
Are they having fun - oh no!
Didn't they even understand you - such a waste of time.
Did they squirm - spot on, keep it up.
Make more puns until there's no life left in your victim.
Then move on to the next until you make it to the top.
